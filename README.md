## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
1. Vehicle Length
2. Ground Clearance

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

No, the slope would not be considered 0. Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance r scores suggests they have a non-random chance of impacting MPG. 


Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

No it does not predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. We are only looking at 5 variables that could impact MPG and I think we would need a lot more information to begin to predict mpg. We are also not really trying to establish the impact that these variables have on mpg, rather we are trying to determine the degree of certainty to with which they do impact mpg.
